st.write("""
E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. 
It is one of the **fastest-growing waste streams globally**, posing significant environmental and health risks due to improper disposal and lack of recycling efforts.

With the rise of **consumer electronics** and **technology advancements**, the e-waste problem is becoming increasingly critical to address.

The chart above illustrates the **growing scale of e-waste generation** and the gap in recycling rates over the past decade. Without immediate action, global e-waste could reach unsustainable levels, further harming the environment.

# Key Facts Section
st.subheader("üìä Key Facts about E-Waste")
st.markdown("""
- **50+ million tons** of e-waste are generated globally every year.  
- Only **20%** of e-waste is formally recycled; the remaining 80% is either dumped, incinerated, or improperly handled.  
- E-waste contains **hazardous materials** such as:
   - üß™ **Lead**, which can cause brain damage.  
   - üß™ **Mercury**, which affects the nervous system.  
   - üß™ **Cadmium**, which damages kidneys and bones.  
- Informal or manual sorting of e-waste is often performed under unsafe conditions, particularly in developing countries.

# Why is E-Waste Dangerous? Section
st.subheader("‚ö†Ô∏è Why is E-Waste Dangerous?")
st.write("""
E-waste contains a mix of **valuable** and **hazardous** materials. When not disposed of properly, it causes:
1. **Environmental Pollution**:
   - Chemicals leach into the soil, contaminating water and food sources.
2. **Health Risks**:
   - Exposure to toxins causes severe health problems such as brain damage, respiratory issues, and cancer.
3. **Resource Wastage**:
   - Precious metals like **gold**, **silver**, and **copper** in e-waste are lost instead of being recycled.

These issues disproportionately affect developing nations, where e-waste is often processed manually under unsafe conditions [2].

# The Solution Section
st.subheader("üõ†Ô∏è How Can Technology Solve the E-Waste Problem?")
st.write("""
Advanced technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Computer Vision** can play a transformative role in addressing the e-waste problem by:
- Automating the **sorting and classification** of e-waste items.
- Improving recycling efficiency by reducing **manual labor risks**.
- Identifying **reusable** and **recyclable** components more effectively.

AI-driven solutions, like the **E-Waste Detection Application** in this project, are a step toward creating a sustainable future.
